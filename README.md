# Django Casper test integration

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dobarkod/django-casper.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dobarkod/django-casper)

A Django application that makes it easy to use CasperJS/PhantomJS for
automated live testing of JavaScript and front/back integration for your
web applications.

[PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) is a headless WebKit with JavaScript
API. It has fast and native support for various web standards.

[CasperJS](http://casperjs.org/) is a navigation scripting & testing utility
for PhantomJS, written in Javascript. While PhantomJS provides bare
essentials, CasperJS provides a simple testing framework specially optimized
for Phantom.

CasperJS assumes there is a web server to connect to while doing the tests.
While it can be done with a bit of creative shell scripting, it's not
immediately obvious how to use CasperJS in context of Django tests, ie.
for its [LiveServerTestCase](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/testing/overview/#django.test.LiveServerTestCase)
tests.

This is where Django Casper comes in.

## How it works

`casper.CasperTestCase` subclasses `LiveServerTestCase` and adds a `casper`
method that can run a CasperJS test case (it is recommended to run multiple
tests in one run to minimize PhantomJS startup / shutdown time (it is quite
slow), but not neccessary) and return whether the test was successful.

The rest of the usage is a usual. Set up the database/fixtures, run the
test(s), assert that everything works as expected.

## Installation and requirements

Django Casper requires a working PhantomJS and CasperJS install, ie. the
`casperjs` command should be available. Refer to the CasperJS page on the
installation details for your system.

Other than that, Django Casper has no additional requirements (it's useless
without a Django project, though).

Install via PyPI:

    pip install django-casper

## Installing from source

To install directly from GitHub source:

    # Download from GitHub
    git clone git@github.com:dobarkod/django-casper.git
    cd django-casper

    # Build
    python setup.py build

    # Optionally, run the self-test
    python setup.py

    # Install it
    python setup.py install

## Usage

First, add `casper` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`.

Then, create the Python part of your tests:

    from casper.tests import CasperTestCase
    import os.path

    class MyTest(CasperTestCase):
        def test_something(self):
            self.assertTrue(self.casper(
                os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__),
                    'casper-tests/test.js')))

Then, create the CasperJS part. Create a `casper-tests` directory somewhere
(eg. in your `tests` directory). Copy `djangocasper.js` helper JS module
from `/wherever/you/installed/django-casper/casper/jslib/` to this directory.
Then, create your CasperJS tests in it.

For example, this test asserts that there's a Login button on the home
page (relative URL `/`), and clicking it sends you to the login page
(relative URL `/login/`):

    casper.test.comment('Casper+Django integration example');
    var helper = require('./djangocasper.js');
    helper.scenario('/',
        function() {
            this.test.assertSelectorHasText('input[type="button"]', 'Login',
                "The home page has a Login button");
            this.click('input[type="button"]');
        },
        function() {
            helper.assertAbsUrl('/login/',
                "After clicking Login, we're redirected to login page");
        }
    );
    helper.run();

For more examples, have a look at the django-casper test suite, the source
for the `djangocasper.js` helper and
[CasperJS Tester API](http://casperjs.org/api.html#tester).

## Passing extra arguments

Sometimes you need to pass extra arguments to your JS tests, for example,
username and password to log in with, or and ID of some object to manipulate.

You can do so by passing them as keyword arguments to the `casper` method
in your Python tests:

    def test_user_can_log_in(self):
        ...  # create user in the database
        self.assertTrue(self.casper(
            os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__),
                'casper-tests/test.js')),
            user=fixture_username,
            pass=fixture_password)

Then access these keyword arguments from the JS file:

    helper.scenario('/login/',
        function() {
            this.fill('form[method=post]', {
                username: casper.cli.options['user'],
                password: casper.cli.options['pass']
            }, true);
        }
    );


## Using the helper

```
from casper.helpers import BaseCasperJs


class MyProjectPageTestCase(BaseCasperJs):
    def test_my_page_js(self):
        # login as a user - use use djangos LiveServerTestCase in casper so this
        # is available
        self.client.login(username=user.username, password=self.password)

        # the js_file in this example is located in "casper-tests" which is a
        # folder the same directory as this test file
        #
        # if your path was:
        # project/tests/file.py 
        # then the casper-tests folder and js file should be created at
        # project/tests/casper-tests/url_to_test.js
        #
        url = reverse('project:url_to_test')
        casper_result = self.load_casper_file(js_file='url_to_test.js',
                                              test_label='Test the Project page',
                                              url=url)

        # evaluate the result
        self.assertTrue(casper_result)

```


## Bypassing log-in procedure

When testing parts of the website for which the client needs to be logged in,
each test scriptcase would need to go through the login procedure first. As
this can be quite slow, it's possible to bypass it by logging in the
Django's test client (`self.client` in the test cases). This will cause the
session cookie to be injected into Phantom, so it will behave as an
authenticated client.

To use this, just use `self.client.login()` as you would normally. See the
`session.js` test in Django Casper self-tests.

## Caveats

Phantom/Casper testing is *very slow* compared to Django's
[TestClient](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial05/#the-django-test-client).
Whenever you have a page that can be accurately tested using only TestClient,
use it, and use Phantom/Casper only for tests where you need to test the
JavaScript behaviour.

Phantom hammers the Django's built-in live testserver a lot, as it requests
all the referenced static assets as well as the page itself, and this can
sometimes result in a deadlock. To avoid this, the runner is limited to 60
seconds per JS file (see the source of `djangocasper.js` for details).

Prior to Django 1.5, Django incorrectly reported last-modified time for
static files, which results in Phantom re-requesting every static file
always, even if it already has uptodate version. This was fixed in Django 1.5,
so it is recommended to use 1.5 or higher version of Django.

## Static files caching

A further speed optimization is possible if you're willing to monkeypatch
Django's test staticfiles handler to tell Phantom to unconditionally cache
the file for a while (by setting the `Expires` HTTP header). If you do so,
you should take care to clear Phantom's disk-cache before the tests start,
so it only caches things between cases of the same test run and doesn't get
stale.

To do so, set `use_phantom_disk_cache` class variable in your test case class:

    class MyTest(CasperTestCase):
        use_phantom_disk_cache = True
        ...

To clean the PhantomJS disk cache, remove `~/.qws/cache/Ofi\ Labs/PhantomJS/`
(as this is pretty-much undocumented feature, make sure to check what the
cache folder of *your* PhantomJS installation is, as it can vary depending
on the underlying OS and the PhantomJS version).
